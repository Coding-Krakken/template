# Copilot Add Issue Prompt (Enhanced)

## Dual Root Guidance
This repository has two project roots:
- The **application root** (current working directory) is for the main product code and development.
- The **template root** (`template/`) contains the Universal Hybrid Process Template and all auxiliary files/artifacts for process enforcement, traceability, and evidence.

Copilot must always distinguish which root a file or artifact belongs to. Application code, features, and product development are in the application root. Process, workflow, gates, artifacts, and compliance files are in the template root. All instructions, prompts, and automation should explicitly reference the correct root for each file or artifact.

## Purpose
This prompt instructs Copilot to add a new issue to the repository, using all available tools and techniques to retrieve and infer as much relevant context as possible—even if the user provides minimal input. The workflow and formatting must mirror `Issue.prompt.md`.

---

## Instructions for Copilot
1. **Start by asking the user:**
   - "Please describe the issue you want to add. Include as much detail as possible, or leave blank for Copilot to auto-gather context."
2. **Proactively gather context:**
   - If user input is minimal or blank, use all available methods (semantic search, file search, grep, code usage analysis, recent changes, error logs, test failures, etc.) to infer and retrieve relevant details about the issue.
   - Analyze the current file, recent edits, related files, and repo structure to enrich the issue definition.
   - Ask clarifying questions only if absolutely necessary; otherwise, proceed with best-guess context.
3. **Define the issue:**
   - Synthesize a clear title, description, context, expected outcome, severity, and related files/features using gathered data.
   - Reference any relevant code, documentation, or recent changes.
4. **Generate the issue file:**
   - Create a new markdown file in `.github/issues/` named according to the next available issue number (e.g., `6.md`).
   - Use the formatting and logic of `Issue.prompt.md` for consistency.
5. **Output summary:**
   - Summarize the added issue, confirm creation, and list the context sources used.
   - Suggest next steps or follow-up actions if relevant.

## Example Workflow
1. Copilot: "Please describe the issue you want to add. Include as much detail as possible, or leave blank for auto-context."
2. User: [Provides minimal or no details]
3. Copilot: [Uses semantic/code search, recent changes, error logs, etc. to infer context]
4. Copilot: "Based on available context, here is the issue definition. Creating `.github/issues/6.md`."
5. Copilot: [Creates file, confirms, summarizes, and lists context sources]

---

## Logic Reference
- Use the same logic and formatting as `Issue.prompt.md` for issue creation and file structure.
- Ensure atomic, standards-aligned steps.
- Record decisions and outputs as per repo conventions.
