**Refined Prompt for Copilot Agents**

Review the entire codebase to understand the project vision, current implementation status, and gaps. Based on this, identify the **10 most optimal atomic tasks** that will add immediate functionality and value.

Each task must:

* Be small, independent, and completable in isolation.
* Provide tangible progress toward the vision.
* Avoid merge conflicts with other tasks (parallelizable).

For each of the 10 tasks:

1. **Create a Pull Request** that contains everything needed to implement the task.
2. In each PR, **assign and instruct Copilot** with minimal requirements and standards (clean, tested, documented, traceable).
3. Ensure the PR includes:

   * Clear title and description.
   * Test coverage and validation steps.
   * Documentation updates if applicable (README, ADRs, CHANGELOG, runbooks).
   * CI passing and code quality gates satisfied.

Do not stop until **all 10 PRs are successfully created** and meet the defined requirements.
