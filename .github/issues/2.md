## Goal & Rationale
Propose automation for issue creation to streamline project management. Supports process efficiency and aligns with vision for scalable operations.

## Scope
- `artifacts/rfc/RFC-NEW-ISSUE-AUTOMATION.md`

## Out of Scope
- No changes to scripts (`scripts/`)
- No changes to existing RFCs

## Acceptance Criteria
- RFC file created with motivation, design, and links to relevant scripts.
- File: `artifacts/rfc/RFC-NEW-ISSUE-AUTOMATION.md`

## Risk & Rollback
- No code or config changes; safe to revert by deleting RFC file.
