## Goal & Rationale
Document the decision to adopt an automated CI gate for compliance checks, improving reliability and auditability. Aligns with project vision and NFRs for compliance and process rigor.

## Scope
- `artifacts/adr/ADR-NEW-CI-COMPLIANCE.md`

## Out of Scope
- No changes to CI scripts (`ci/`)
- No changes to requirements files (`requirements/`)

## Acceptance Criteria
- ADR file created with rationale, alternatives, and links to vision/NFR docs.
- File: `artifacts/adr/ADR-NEW-CI-COMPLIANCE.md`

## Risk & Rollback
- No code or config changes; safe to revert by deleting ADR file.

## Links
- [docs/vision.md]
- [requirements/nfr.yml]
