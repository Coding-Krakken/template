## Goal & Rationale
Create a runbook for onboarding new engineers, improving operational readiness and knowledge transfer. Supports scaling and reliability goals.

## Scope
- `runbooks/onboarding.md`

## Out of Scope
- No changes to other runbooks
- No changes to ops docs

## Acceptance Criteria
- Runbook file created with clear onboarding steps and links to relevant ops documentation.
- File: `runbooks/onboarding.md`

## Risk & Rollback
- No code or config changes; safe to revert by deleting runbook file.

## Links
- [docs/ops/README.md]
- [runbooks/calibration.md]
