## Goal & Rationale
Create a standardized release plan template to improve reliability and repeatability of rollouts. Aligns with NFRs for operational excellence.

## Scope
- `artifacts/rollout/PLAN-NEW-RELEASE.md`

## Out of Scope
- No changes to existing rollout plans
- No changes to release runbooks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Release plan template created with checklist and links to release steps documentation.
- File: `artifacts/rollout/PLAN-NEW-RELEASE.md`

## Risk & Rollback
- No code or config changes; safe to revert by deleting plan file.

- [runbooks/release_steps.md]
- [artifacts/rollout/RUN_TEMPLATE.md]
