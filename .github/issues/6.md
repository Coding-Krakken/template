# 📝 GitHub Issue: Validate Process Workflow Failure

## 1. Issue Type
- [x] Bug
- [ ] Feature Request
- [ ] Enhancement
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Compliance
- [ ] Other: _Please specify_

## 2. Summary
> The validate process workflow (CI job and/or `ci/validate_graph.py`) fails repeatedly, blocking progress through required gates. This prevents compliance and release activities.

---

## 3. Context & Impact
- **Related files/modules:**
  - `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
  - `ci/validate_graph.py`
  - `.process/graph.yaml`
  - `artifacts/gate/`
- **Environment:** Hybrid workflow repo, CI (GitHub Actions), Python 3.x, PyYAML
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Blast Radius:** All contributors; blocks releases, compliance, and evidence validation
- **Deadline/Target Release:** ASAP

---

## 4. Steps to Reproduce / Implementation Plan
### For Bugs:
1. Trigger the "Validate Process" workflow (e.g., via PR or manual run).
2. Observe failure in the "Validate process graph" step or related gate checks.
3. Review logs for errors in `ci/validate_graph.py` (e.g., missing nodes, invalid transitions, artifact existence).
4. Expected: Workflow passes if graph and gates are valid; Actual: Workflow fails, blocking progress.

---

## 5. Screenshots / Evidence
> See CI logs, error output from `ci/validate_graph.py`, and related gate enforcement scripts.

---

## 6. Suggested Next Steps
- Investigate recent changes to `.process/graph.yaml` and gate artifacts.
- Review error output from `ci/validate_graph.py` and `ci/check_gates.py`.
- Ensure all referenced nodes and artifacts exist and conform to schema.
- Update documentation if process or requirements have changed.
- If root cause is unclear, schedule a recalibration session per `runbooks/calibration.md`.
