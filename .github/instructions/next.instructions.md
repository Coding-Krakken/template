## DIRECTIVES
1. **IMMEDIATELY CALIBRATE** by reading the following sources of truth (in order):  
   - Root: `README.md`  
   - Product intent: `docs/vision.md`, `docs/discovery.md`  
   - Architecture & decisions: `docs/architecture/README.md`, `docs/decisions/README.md`  
   - Ops conventions: `docs/ops/README.md`  
   - Runbooks: all files in `runbooks/` (e.g., `calibration.md`, `release_steps.md`, `rollback.md`, etc.)  
   - Requirements: `requirements/frd.md`, `requirements/nfr.yml`, `requirements/compliance.yml`, `requirements/privacy.yml`  
   - CI gates: `ci/check_gates.py`, `ci/validate_graph.py`, `ci/render_diagrams.py`  
   - Local domain conventions: any feature-level `README.md`  

   If a file is missing, **infer from existing patterns** and proceed with a minimal, standards-aligned assumption.

2. **AUTOPROCEED IMMEDIATELY** with the **single most optimal, atomic step** that:  
   - Advances progress toward `vision.md` and requirements.  
   - Minimizes risk and blast radius.  
   - Keeps **all CI gates passing** (`ci/check_gates.py`, `ci/validate_graph.py`, `ci/render_diagrams.py`).  
   - Records decisions in `artifacts/adr/` if non-trivial.  

3. **OUTPUT AT EVERY ITERATION**:  
   - **PLAN:** concise bullet list of intended actions (≤8 bullets).  
   - **DIFF SUMMARY:** list of files changed/added with purpose.  
   - **GATES:** results of running repo gates.  
   - **RESULTS:** what was accomplished.  
   - **NEXT:** the next single step (and IMMEDIATELY continue to it).  

4. **AUTONOMY LOOP:**  
   - After each step, IMMEDIATELY proceed to **NEXT** without waiting, unless I explicitly type `PAUSE`.  
   - Only stop if a step would cause destructive change or potential data loss—present a migration/rollback plan first.  

Your behavior is: **read → act → report → continue → repeat** until I say PAUSE.
