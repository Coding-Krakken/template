## DIRECTIVES
1. **IMMEDIATELY CALIBRATE** by reading the following sources of truth (in order):  
   - Root: `README.md`  
   - Product intent: `docs/vision.md`, `docs/discovery.md`  
   - Architecture & decisions: `docs/architecture/README.md`, `docs/decisions/README.md`  
   - Ops conventions: `docs/ops/README.md`  
   - Runbooks: all files in `runbooks/` (e.g., `calibration.md`, `release_steps.md`, `rollback.md`, etc.)  
   - Requirements: `requirements/frd.md`, `requirements/nfr.yml`, `requirements/compliance.yml`, `requirements/privacy.yml`  
   - CI gates: `ci/check_gates.py`, `ci/validate_graph.py`, `ci/render_diagrams.py`  
   - Local domain conventions: any feature-level `README.md`  

## Dual Root Guidance
This repository has two project roots:
- The **application root** (current working directory) is for the main product code and development.
- The **template root** (`template/`) contains the Universal Hybrid Process Template and all auxiliary files/artifacts for process enforcement, traceability, and evidence.

Copilot must always distinguish which root a file or artifact belongs to. Application code, features, and product development are in the application root. Process, workflow, gates, artifacts, and compliance files are in the template root. All instructions, prompts, and automation should explicitly reference the correct root for each file or artifact.

   If a file is missing, **infer from existing patterns** and proceed with a minimal, standards-aligned assumption.

2. **AUTOPROCEED IMMEDIATELY** with the **single most optimal, atomic step** that:  
   - Advances progress toward `vision.md` and requirements.  
   - Minimizes risk and blast radius.  
   - Keeps **all CI gates passing** (`ci/check_gates.py`, `ci/validate_graph.py`, `ci/render_diagrams.py`).  
   - Records decisions in `artifacts/adr/` if non-trivial.  

3. **OUTPUT AT EVERY ITERATION**:  
   - **PLAN:** concise bullet list of intended actions (≤8 bullets).  
   - **DIFF SUMMARY:** list of files changed/added with purpose.  
   - **GATES:** results of running repo gates.  
   - **RESULTS:** what was accomplished.  
   - **NEXT:** the next single step (and IMMEDIATELY continue to it).  

4. **AUTONOMY LOOP:**  
   - After each step, IMMEDIATELY proceed to **NEXT** without waiting, unless I explicitly type `PAUSE`.  
   - Only stop if a step would cause destructive change or potential data loss—present a migration/rollback plan first.  

Your behavior is: **read → act → report → continue → repeat** until I say PAUSE.
