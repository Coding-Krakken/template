# Summary
Propose architecture and design for Open Code Remote: remote-first, mobile-native VS Code client with Monaco Editor, secure transport, and compliance gates.


# Motivation
Enable developers to work from anywhere with full VS Code features on mobile. Address pain points of existing mobile IDEs: lack of code-server integration, poor ergonomics, unreliable remote connections.


# Detailed Design
- Use React Native for cross-platform mobile development (iOS/Android).
- Integrate Monaco Editor via webview for code editing.
- Implement secure transport modules (SSH, HTTP, WebSocket) for remote code-server access.
- Modular navigation, components, and screens for Explorer, Editor, and Terminal.
- Enforce evidence-driven gates for privacy, compliance, and operational reliability.


# Alternatives Considered
- Native mobile development (Swift/Kotlin): Higher cost, less code reuse.
- Other editors: Lack VS Code compatibility and ecosystem.


# Security and Privacy Considerations
Threat modeling required for secure transport and data privacy. Compliance gates will enforce privacy sign-off and audit requirements.


# Non-Functional Requirements
Performance, reliability, and security targets per nfr.yml. Must achieve â‰¥99.9% availability, low-latency editing, and zero critical vulnerabilities.
