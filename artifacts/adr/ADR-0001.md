## Context
Architecture and design for Open Code Remote must support remote-first, mobile-native VS Code functionality, Monaco Editor integration, secure transport, and compliance gates. Decision aligns with RFC-0001 and product vision/discovery.


## Decision
- Use React Native for cross-platform mobile development (iOS/Android).
- Integrate Monaco Editor via webview for code editing.
- Implement secure transport modules (SSH, HTTP, WebSocket) for remote code-server access.
- Enforce evidence-driven gates for privacy, compliance, and operational reliability.
- Structure app with modular navigation, components, and screens for Explorer, Editor, and Terminal.
