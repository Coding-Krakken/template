# ADR: Product Vision & Discovery (2025-08-25)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Initial product vision and discovery for Open Code Remote have been defined and documented in `docs/vision.md` and `docs/discovery.md`.

## Decision
- The product will focus on remote-first, mobile-native VS Code experience, integrating Monaco Editor and terminal features for mobile ergonomics.
- Secure, performant remote connections (SSH, HTTP, WebSocket) are required.
- Compliance, privacy, and operational reliability will be enforced via evidence-driven gates and continuous calibration.
- KPIs and objectives are established for availability, latency, compliance, and user engagement.

## Consequences
- All subsequent architecture, design, and planning will align with this vision and discovery.
- CI gates and process enforcement will be calibrated to these goals and requirements.
