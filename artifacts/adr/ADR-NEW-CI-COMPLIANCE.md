title: "Adopt Automated CI Gate for Compliance Checks"
status: proposed
date: 2024-12-19
owners: [engineering-team]
inputs: [req-nfr, docs-vision, req-compliance]
options:
  - name: Automated CI Compliance Gates
    pros: 
      - Consistent compliance enforcement across all changes
      - Reduced manual oversight burden
      - Improved auditability and traceability
      - Prevents compliance drift through automated checks
      - Integrates with existing gate infrastructure
    cons: 
      - Initial setup and configuration overhead
      - Potential for false positives requiring refinement
      - May slow down development velocity initially
  - name: Manual Compliance Review Process
    pros: 
      - Human judgment for edge cases
      - Flexible for unique situations
      - Lower initial technical complexity
    cons: 
      - Inconsistent enforcement
      - Higher manual labor costs
      - Risk of human error and oversight
      - Poor auditability and scaling
      - Does not align with process-as-code vision
  - name: Hybrid Manual/Automated Approach
    pros:
      - Combines automation with human oversight
      - Gradual transition path
    cons:
      - Complexity of maintaining two systems
      - Unclear handoff points
      - Potential for gaps in coverage
decision: Automated CI Compliance Gates
justification: >
  Automated CI compliance gates align with the project's vision of process-as-code
  and evidence-driven development. They provide consistent enforcement, improve
  auditability, and scale effectively. The existing CI gate infrastructure 
  (ci/check_gates.py) already provides the foundation for this capability.
  Manual processes introduce inconsistency and don't meet our NFR requirements
  for reliability and traceability.

## Context

The project vision emphasizes process-as-code with evidence-driven development and automated enforcement of quality, security, and compliance requirements. Currently, compliance checks are handled through manual processes and checklists (requirements/compliance_checklist.md), which introduces inconsistency, scaling challenges, and audit risks.

The existing CI infrastructure already includes automated gates for design (G-design) and verification (G-verify) through ci/check_gates.py. The Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) specification in requirements/nfr.yml defines security, reliability, and maintainability targets that need consistent enforcement.

Key drivers for this decision:
- Need for consistent compliance enforcement across all code changes
- Alignment with the project's process-as-code and evidence-driven vision
- Reduction of manual oversight burden on compliance teams
- Improvement of auditability and traceability for regulatory requirements
- Integration with existing gate infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

## Decision

We will adopt automated CI gates for compliance checks by extending the existing gate enforcement infrastructure. This includes:

1. **Leveraging existing gate infrastructure**: Build upon ci/check_gates.py to include compliance artifact validation
2. **Evidence-based compliance**: Require machine-readable evidence for compliance requirements (similar to security SARIF reports)
3. **Automated enforcement**: Block code changes that don't meet compliance requirements without proper evidence
4. **Audit trail**: Generate compliance reports and maintain traceability through the CI pipeline

The solution will integrate with the existing process graph and gate system, ensuring compliance checks are treated as first-class gates alongside security, performance, and quality gates.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**
- **Consistency**: All changes will be subject to the same compliance standards automatically
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trail of compliance decisions and evidence
- **Scalability**: System scales with team growth without proportional compliance overhead
- **Reliability**: Reduces human error in compliance oversight
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing CI/CD and gate infrastructure
- **Vision Alignment**: Supports the process-as-code vision and evidence-driven development approach

**Trade-offs:**
- **Initial Setup**: Requires configuration and refinement of compliance rules and thresholds
- **Learning Curve**: Development teams need to understand compliance requirements and evidence generation
- **Potential Friction**: May initially slow development velocity while teams adapt
- **False Positives**: Automated systems may flag legitimate cases requiring refinement

**Follow-up Work Required:**
- Define specific compliance artifacts and evidence formats
- Configure compliance policies within the gate system
- Train development teams on compliance evidence generation
- Establish monitoring and alerting for compliance gate health
- Create runbooks for handling compliance gate failures
