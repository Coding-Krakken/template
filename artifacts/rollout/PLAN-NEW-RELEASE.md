# Standardized Release Plan Template

Use this template to create comprehensive release plans that ensure reliability and repeatability of rollouts. This template aligns with NFRs for operational excellence and references established procedures.

## Release Information

- **Release ID**: [e.g., v1.2.3 or RELEASE-2024-Q1]
- **Release Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Release Owner**: [primary contact]
- **Stakeholders**: [list of stakeholders and their roles]
- **Release Type**: [major/minor/patch/hotfix]

## Pre-Release Checklist

Reference: [runbooks/release_steps.md](../../runbooks/release_steps.md#pre-release-checklist)

### Gate Validation
- [ ] All gates in `.process/graph.yaml` have been passed and evidence is attached
- [ ] Security scans show 0 critical vulnerabilities (per NFR requirement)
- [ ] Performance tests meet p95 latency < 200ms target (per NFR)
- [ ] Code coverage â‰¥ 80% (per NFR maintainability requirements)

### Build & Verification
- [ ] Regression tests are green
- [ ] Performance tests are green  
- [ ] Security tests are green
- [ ] A release candidate build is available and verified
- [ ] Build artifacts are tagged and stored securely

### Preparation
- [ ] Stakeholders are informed of the release date and contents
- [ ] Rollback plan is documented and tested (see [runbooks/rollback.md](../../runbooks/rollback.md))
- [ ] Feature flags are configured and ready
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards and alerts are configured
- [ ] On-call team is notified and prepared

## Release Stages

Reference: [runbooks/release_steps.md](../../runbooks/release_steps.md#release-process)

### Stage 1: Tag and Build
- [ ] Create release tag in version control
- [ ] Build release artifact
- [ ] Verify artifact integrity
- [ ] **Checkpoint**: Build artifacts available and verified

### Stage 2: Canary Deployment (Target: 5% traffic)
- [ ] Deploy to canary environment
- [ ] Monitor metrics for defined canary period (minimum 30 minutes)
- [ ] Verify error budgets within SLO limits (99.9% availability per NFR)
- [ ] Validate performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] **Checkpoint**: Canary stable, metrics within thresholds

### Stage 3: Gradual Rollout
- [ ] **25% Traffic**: Deploy and monitor for 1 hour
  - [ ] Error rates < baseline + 5%
  - [ ] p95 latency < 200ms (NFR target)
  - [ ] No critical alerts
- [ ] **50% Traffic**: Deploy and monitor for 1 hour
  - [ ] Error rates stable
  - [ ] Performance metrics stable
  - [ ] Customer feedback positive
- [ ] **100% Traffic**: Full rollout
  - [ ] All metrics stable
  - [ ] Error budgets within limits
  - [ ] **Checkpoint**: Full rollout complete

### Stage 4: Post-Release Verification
- [ ] Execute smoke tests
- [ ] Perform user experience checks
- [ ] Confirm no major regressions
- [ ] Validate all feature flags working as expected
- [ ] **Checkpoint**: Release verified and stable

## Communication & Documentation

- [ ] Release announcement prepared and sent to stakeholders
- [ ] Release notes updated and published
- [ ] Internal documentation updated
- [ ] Customer-facing documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Related tickets and issues closed

## Monitoring & Post-Release Activities

Reference: [runbooks/release_steps.md](../../runbooks/release_steps.md#post-release-activities)

### 24-Hour Monitoring Window
- [ ] Monitor error rates, latency, and throughput
- [ ] Track business metrics and KPIs
- [ ] Review logs for anomalies
- [ ] Respond to any alerts within 15-minute RTO (NFR requirement)

### 48-Hour Extended Monitoring  
- [ ] Continue monitoring key metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Document any deviations from planned process
- [ ] Update runbooks if process improvements identified

## Fallback Procedures

Reference: [runbooks/rollback.md](../../runbooks/rollback.md)

### Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Error rate increases > 10% from baseline
- [ ] p95 latency exceeds 200ms NFR target
- [ ] Customer-impacting issues reported
- [ ] Security incidents detected
- [ ] SLO breach imminent (< 99.9% availability)

### Rollback Process
- [ ] **Immediate**: Disable feature flags (if applicable)
- [ ] **Within 5 minutes**: Begin rollback deployment
- [ ] **Within 15 minutes**: Complete rollback (RTO requirement)
- [ ] **Post-rollback**: Verify system stability
- [ ] **Follow-up**: Schedule postmortem and root cause analysis

## Metrics & Evidence

Link to experiment tracking: [artifacts/rollout/RUN_TEMPLATE.md](RUN_TEMPLATE.md)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Deployment completed within planned timeline
- [ ] All NFR targets met (latency, availability, throughput)
- [ ] Zero critical issues or outages
- [ ] Customer satisfaction maintained or improved
- [ ] Error budgets preserved

### Evidence Requirements
- [ ] Performance test results
- [ ] Security scan reports  
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards screenshots
- [ ] Deployment logs and artifacts
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-offs
