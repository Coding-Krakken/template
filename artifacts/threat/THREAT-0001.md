## Overview
Threat modeling for Open Code Remote, focusing on secure transport, data privacy, and mobile attack surfaces. STRIDE analysis and mitigations documented for initial architecture.

## STRIDE Analysis

| Category | Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Spoofing | Authentication for remote connections (SSH, HTTP, WebSocket) | Unauthorized access | Strong authentication, encrypted transport |
| Tampering | Integrity of code, files, and transport | Corrupted code/data | Integrity checks, encrypted transport |
| Repudiation | Audit logs for remote actions | Lack of accountability | Logging, audit trails |
| Information Disclosure | Data privacy, secure storage, encrypted transport | Data leak | Encryption, privacy gates, secure storage |
| Denial of Service | Availability of remote code-server and mobile app | Service outage | Monitoring, fallback procedures |
| Elevation of Privilege | Least privilege for app permissions and remote access | Unauthorized actions | Least privilege, permission controls |


## Attack Surfaces
- Remote transport modules (SSH, HTTP, WebSocket)
- Mobile app permissions and storage
- Code-server endpoints


## Privacy Considerations
- Enforce privacy sign-off and compliance gates
- Data minimization and secure storage


## Mitigations
- Use strong authentication and encrypted transport for all remote connections
- Enforce privacy sign-off and compliance gates
- Monitor and log remote actions for auditability
- Apply least privilege and secure storage for sensitive data
