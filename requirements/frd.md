# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

## User Stories

- As a developer, I can start a new project with a single command.
- As a lead, I can enforce coverage, security, and documentation gates.
- As a PM, I can track methodology and rollout toggles.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All required files and folders exist after bootstrap.
- CI fails if coverage or docs gates are unmet.
- Example service exposes /health, /ready, /metrics endpoints.
