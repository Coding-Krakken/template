# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

This document captures the **functional requirements** for your project.  It
should answer the question: *what should the system do?*

## Overview

Provide a brief description of the systemâ€™s purpose and scope.  Describe the
stakeholders and users.  Link back to the vision document if necessary.

## User Stories / Use Cases

List user stories or use cases that describe the expected interactions with
the system.  Use the *As a <user>, I want <goal> so that <reason>* format.

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| FR-1 | | Must | |
| FR-2 | | Should | |
| FR-3 | | Could | |

Define each functional requirement with a unique ID, a short description, a
priority (e.g. Must/Should/Could), and acceptance criteria for verifying the
requirement is met.

## Dependencies

List any external systems, services, or data sources that the functionality
depends on.
