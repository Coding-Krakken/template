# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

## User Stories

- As a developer, I can start a new project with a single command and have all guardrails in place.
- As a lead, I can enforce coverage, security, and documentation gates for every commit and PR.
- As a PM, I can track methodology, rollout toggles, and feature flag usage across environments.
- As an SRE, I can monitor service health, readiness, and metrics via standardized endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All required files, folders, and configs exist after bootstrap.
- CI fails if coverage, security, or documentation gates are unmet.
- Example service exposes /health, /ready, /metrics endpoints and returns correct status codes.
- Feature flags can be toggled at runtime and are reflected in service behavior.
- OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics are present in all services.
