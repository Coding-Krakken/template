   scope and severity of the incident.  Classify the incident according to
   severity levels.
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: Remove malicious artifacts, patch vulnerabilities, and
   harden defenses.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to a known good state.  Validate that
   services operate normally and data integrity is maintained.
6. **Notification**: If personal data is involved, notify authorities and
   affected individuals within the time frame specified in `requirements/privacy.yml`.
