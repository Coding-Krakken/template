# Self-Review Checklist

- Correctness: Does the code do what it should? Are edge cases handled?
- Performance: Is the code efficient? Any unnecessary complexity?
- Readability: Is the code clear and maintainable?
- NFRs met: Are all non-functional requirements (latency, availability, security, etc.) satisfied?
- Tests and docs updated: Are there tests for new/changed code? Is documentation current?
- Example: Before merging, verify all CI checks pass and ADRs are updated if needed.
