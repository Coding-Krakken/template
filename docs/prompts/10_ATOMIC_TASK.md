# Atomic Task Protocol

- Make the smallest possible change (atomic commit).
- Always add/modify tests first (TDD: Test-Driven Development).
- Document the change and update ADRs if architecture is affected.
- Reference requirements and vision for every change.
- Example: If adding a new endpoint, first add a failing test, then implement, then update docs and ADRs if needed.
