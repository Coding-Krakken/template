# Decision Records

This directory should contain **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** and
other decision logs.  Use the ADR template in `artifacts/adr/` to record
important technical and process decisions.  Keep decisions small and scoped
whenever possible.

Organize ADRs chronologically and by category if helpful.  Include crossâ€‘links
to relevant RFCs, threat models, or experiment results.
