# Architecture Documents

Place architecture diagrams, design specifications, and system overviews in this
directory.  Each document should have a clear purpose and tie back to the
process graph:

* **Highâ€‘level Architecture**: Show system boundaries, major components, and
  integrations.  Include data flow diagrams and context diagrams.
* **Subsystem Design**: Provide detailed documentation for individual
  services or components, including interfaces, dependencies, and data models.
* **API Specifications**: Define REST, gRPC, GraphQL, or other API contracts.
* **Data Models**: Document schemas, migrations, and data lineage.

Use the templates in `artifacts/` (e.g. ADRs, RFCs, threat models) to record
decisions and rationale.  Link to these documents from here as appropriate.
