# Discovery

The discovery document captures what you learn during the research and
exploration phase.  It informs your architectural decisions and planning.

## Stakeholder Analysis

List all stakeholders (users, customers, partners, internal teams) and describe
their needs, expectations and influence on the project.

## Competitive Analysis

Survey existing solutions or competitors.  Summarize their strengths and
weaknesses.  Identify opportunities for differentiation.

## Technical Landscape

Document existing systems, technologies and constraints that will impact your
project.  Note any high‑risk areas or unknowns that require further research.

## Research Findings

Summarize key insights from user interviews, surveys, experiments, or data
analysis.  Highlight pain points, user journeys, and unmet needs.

## Risks and Mitigations

Identify risks discovered during discovery (technical, market, regulatory).  Propose
mitigations or experiments to reduce uncertainty.
