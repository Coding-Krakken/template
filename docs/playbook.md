# Template Engineering Playbook

## Process: Scrum

This template repository is engineered for teams using Scrum. All template features, CI gates, and overlays are designed to support iterative, sprint-based development, backlog management, and atomic delivery.

### Key Practices

- Sprint planning and backlog refinement
- Atomic, auditable commits
- CI/CD gates for coverage, docs, security, and feature toggles
- ADRs and docs updated on API change
- Feature flags and observability stubs for safe experimentation

Refer to the overlay system and canonical scripts for repeatable, idempotent template updates.
