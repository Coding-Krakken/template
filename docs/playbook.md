# Playbook

## Workflow

- Branches: feature, bugfix, release
- Releases: tag-based, CI gated
- Triage: PRs require tests, docs, and atomic commits
- Incident: Follow runbooks, update ADRs if architecture changes

## Methodology

- Scrum: Sprint cadence, Definition of Done (DoD) required
- Kanban: WIP limits, continuous flow
