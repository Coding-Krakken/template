# Operations Documentation

Store operational documentation here, such as:

* **Runbooks**: Onâ€‘call procedures, deployment instructions, rollback
  procedures, and calibration guides.  See the `runbooks/` directory.
* **Monitoring and Observability**: Dashboards, alert definitions, and SLO
  configurations.
* **Incident Management**: Processes for triaging, resolving, and
  postmortem writing.

Link to relevant policies and scripts in `.process/policies/` and `ci/` that
enforce operational gates and recalibration.
