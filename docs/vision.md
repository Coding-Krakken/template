# Vision

Use this document to articulate the **long‑term vision** for your project or
product.  The vision serves as the North Star that aligns the team and
stakeholders around a common goal.

## Problem Statement

Describe the core problem you are trying to solve.  Explain who the users are
and why the current situation is inadequate.

## Goals and Success Criteria

List the high‑level goals of the project.  Define how you will measure success
using quantitative and qualitative metrics.

## Constraints and Assumptions

Identify any constraints (technical, regulatory, budgetary, etc.) and
assumptions you are making.  These will inform trade‑offs later in the
process.

## Roadmap Overview

Provide a rough timeline of major milestones.  This is not a commitment to
dates but a way to visualize how the vision unfolds over time.
